 *

   * - The command must start with a forward slash character (/).
   * - The command must be composed of one or more uppercase or lowercase letters.
   * - The letters in the command may be separated by one underscore (_).
   * - The command must end with a single letter.
   *
   * @example
   *
   * The following route will match `/hello` command
